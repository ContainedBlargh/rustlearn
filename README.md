# rustlearn

Learning to use Rust by implementing Neural Networks using ArrayFire.

## ArrayFire

[ArrayFire](http://arrayfire.org/docs/index.htm) is a library for matrix/vector arrays that runs a bit faster than regular run-off-the-mill vectors.

I use the Rust package for this library [`arrayfire`](http://arrayfire.org/arrayfire-rust/arrayfire/index.html),
however, the library itself must be installed separately for the code to run.

I will probably rehost the windows executable for installing the library, as the ArrayFire server is very slow (at time of writing, 2019-12-23).
